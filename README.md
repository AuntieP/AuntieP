AuntieP/AuntieP is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
One day I want to create an alternative, safe place for those I've allowed, and only those, to communicate with each other and with me. Like social media only safe. No curating of images, just honestly who I am and what I want to say.
I won't name the name it will be called because I fear it may be jumped on by the criminals that also, obviously, infest this site.
